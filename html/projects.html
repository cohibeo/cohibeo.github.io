        <p>
          This hovercraft build was completed in a mechanical/electrical engineering course using a collaborative
          workflow. I led planning and divided responsibilities into docking, material prep, and assembly support.
        </p>
        <p>
          The craft's base used square plywood. I measured the center with a meter stick and string to cut a circular
          platform, then drilled center and equidistant holes to reduce weight. Sanding and filler minimized splintering,
          and PVC flanges were added for secure airflow routing.

        <p>
          A flexible skirt was stapled and taped around the perimeter in a hemi-torus shape to improve sealing and reduce drag. 
          The PVC assembly was constructed from available parts, but testing revealed leaks at connector joints which were taped 
          and resealed for stability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The craft reached a stable hover and light propulsion. If revisiting the build, I would redesign the thrust
          layout to direct airflow toward the skirt's center for a greater lift to weight ratio.

        <p>
          This demonstration modeled projectile motion using measured launch distances and a fixed target layout.
          The goal was to calculate a trajectory that would pass through multiple hoops and land in a designated cup.
        </p>
        <p>
          We validated measurements as a group, then I used the data to compute time, initial velocity components,
          and displacement checks. The first launch missed, so we refined placement and used slow-motion video
          to calibrate the final alignment.

        <p>
          I built an electronics-based game using a microcontroller, sensor boards, and ultrasonic detectors.
          The biggest challenge was powering multiple boards and translating block-style logic into stable sensor
          code. Iteration and debugging were required to keep readings consistent and reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Power distribution was facilitated using a Raspberry Pi as a USB-hub, deploying code changes with ease.
          Modular wiring made setup easier, allowing for on-the-fly adjustments and improved test reliability.

          A three-person research team evaluated material performance for buoyancy and depth tolerance. We compared
          multiple materials using a predictive model to estimate maximum depth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The analysis consistently favored synthetic foam for sustained depth performance. I led the technical
          write-up and presentation, focusing on clear communication of assumptions and model limitations.

          This app explored cybersecurity concepts such as encryption and password complexity.
          Building in an unfamiliar language required steady debugging and incremental improvements
          to keep the project on track.
        </p>
        <p>
          In future iterations, I would refine the UI for clarity and structure the codebase into
          smaller components for faster testing and easier maintenance.
