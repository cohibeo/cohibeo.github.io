    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Future doctorate aerospace engineering student from Gwinnett County, driven by
      curiosity, resilience, and the belief that every failure is an iteration
      toward something better.

    <h2 class="section-title">Direction</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        My goal is to earn a PhD in aerospace engineering and contribute to the
        programs that push humanity beyond Earth. Projects like NASA's
        <b>Gateway</b> and the <b>Artemis</b> missions represent the kind of work I want
        to spend my career on: large-scale, collaborative engineering that demands precision, 
        iteration, and persistence through failure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I approach that goal by working through it. Building hovercrafts, debugging code, 
        calculating trajectories, and scavenging failed rocket fins have each taught me the 
        <em>why</em> that textbooks could not. I chase the question of <em>why</em>; why an adhesive
        failed where it did, why small design changes so drastically affect stability. I get lost 
        in the pursuit of an answer because my curiosity drives me to know <em>why</em>.

    <h2 class="section-title">Academic Rigor</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        I seek out the hardest coursework available to me. My senior year includes three AP science 
        courses (AP Environmental Science, AP Biology, and AP Physics C: Mechanics) alongside AP Calculus 
        BC, AP Spanish, AP Literature and Composition and dual enrollment at the University of North Georgia 
        in ENGL 1102, ECON 1101, and POLS 1101. To better suit my future, I had planned to swap AP Literature 
        and Composition for ENGL 1102 to guarantee credit if possible. By the end of this year I will have 
        taken 14 AP classes (15 counting AP Literature and Composition) and 3 dual enrollment courses.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also work toward biliteracy, not as a requirement but as a commitment to communicating more effectively 
        with my peers and preparing for acareer in fields that are inherently international and diverse.

    <h2 class="section-title">Resilience</h2>

        &ldquo;You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to 
        encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p class="quote-attribution">&mdash; Maya Angelou</p>
      <p>
        My path has not been straightforward. I have navigated significant personal adversity with instability at home 
        that, at its worst, blurred my academic focus and threatened the goals I had set for myself. My sophomore year 
        was the hardest. My grades suffered, and the path forward was unclear.
      </p>
      <p>
        What changed was a decision: to build the environment I needed rather than wait for one to appear. I leaned on 
        close friends who showed up for me when it mattered most, held myself accountable, and gradually rebuilt my habits, 
        my confidence, and my trajectory. I sought out harder coursework, took on greater responsibility, and earned leadership 
        roles I once thought were out of reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        My history has built me, but it does not define me. I defined me. The resilience I carry is not abstract, it was forged 
        through real challenge, and it shapes how I approach every task I take on today.

    <h2 class="section-title">Beyond the Work</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        When I step away from coursework and projects, I spend my time watching science and engineering creators like Veritasium, 
        Physics Girl, the B1M, and Kurzgesagt. Learning about ideas&mdash;from black holes and particle physics to international projects 
        like ITER&mdash;reinforces the curiosity that drives everything else. Realizing how much remains unknown is what draws me deeper into STEM.

        Quiet evenings usually come with the added company of my cat, Quinn, who will eventually find her way onto my lap if I sit still 
        long enough. She makes the downtime better.
