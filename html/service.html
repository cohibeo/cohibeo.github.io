      Community-based leadership focused on rebuilding programs, expanding participation,
      and maintaining suitable communication for nearly 200 students.

          I joined the leadership team of a service organization during a challenging transition period
          in sophomore year. The organization faced sponsor changes and uncertainty, so our team focused 
          on continuity by identifying new sponsors and rebuilding the program the following year.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked with the leadership team to rebuild the program, keep members engaged, and build new
          traditions. We created Paws of Appreciation to recognize staff members across the school, with our
          second annual Paws of Appreciation event planned and in the works for later this year.

    <h2 class="section-title">Beta Club Growth & Communication</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Membership increased to 182 participants and continued to grow through structured events, service drives, 
        appreciation initiatives, and tutoring events. We organized seasonal outreach projects and encouraged
        deeper engagement beyond attendance at our meetings by having members participate in service activities 
        while discussing the future direction of the club.
      </p>
      <p>
        The largest challenge was communication consistency. Members often missed updates or were left unclear about 
        event details. To resolve this, I advocated and ensured the use of Instagram, Remind, and email, ensuring members 
        received updates well before events. This improved turnout and participation, with measurable increases in event turnout.

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        While statistics, in my opinion, are not the most definitive measure of impact, they do provide a clear picture of my contributions. 
        Over the past four years, I have completed <b>262 documented service hours</b> ranging from community outreach, food donations, school 
        events, and organizational leadership. My commitment to engage with my community reflects that service is a core part of my high school 
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently working toward earning the <b>Georgia Civic Engagement Diploma Seal</b>, a state recognition awarded to students who 
        demonstrate sustained community participation through service and civic engagement. I presented my portfolio today, and the only remaining 
        requirement is the American Government Basic Skills Test.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earning this seal represents what I value most: taking the opportunity to make meaningful, lasting contributions to my community.
